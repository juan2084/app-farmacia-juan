- Once we have successfully installed Node.js on our systems, we continue to install Expo. This system allows you to quickly deploy your app on a physical smartphone or an emulator in a simple way.

  At the Windows command prompt with admin privileges, we must type the following command:

  npm i -g expo-cli

- Choosing a Development Environment for React Native:
  In my case, I use Visual Studio Code, as it has certain
  features, plus it's a free IDE.

- Use a package manager for JavaScript, such as Npm or Yarn.
